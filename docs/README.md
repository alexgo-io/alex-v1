# What is ALEX?

## ALEX is an open-source DeFi development company built on Stacks Blockchain modelled on the world’s financial markets.

At ALEX, you can

* Lend your BTC and earn fixed or variable interest
* Borrow BTC without risk of liquidation
* Mitigate risk with BTC short positions
* Maximize upside with BTC leveraged long positions

## Think of us as [Compound](https://compound.finance) / [AAVE](https://aave.om) with underlying technology like [Balancer](https://balancer.finance), but user experience of [Robinhood](https://www.robinhood.com).

Our initial focus \(v1\) is

* Build DeFi primitives targeting developers looking to build ecosystem on Stacks, and
* Simplify the user experience going from\(to\) CeFi to\(from\) DeFi to attract non-developers, broadening the Stacks user base.

alex-v1 implements a number of Clarity smart contracts on the core concept of Yield Tokens \("ayTokens"\). Yield Tokens allow term lending with fixed APY.
