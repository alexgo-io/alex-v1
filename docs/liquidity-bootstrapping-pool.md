# Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool

Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool \("LBP"\) was first offered by [Balancer](https://docs.balancer.fi/v/v1/guides/smart-pool-templates-gui/liquidity-bootstrapping-pool) in 2020 and can be an interesting alternative to ICOs, IDOs or IEOs to bootstrap liquidity with little initial investment from the team.

ALEX brings LBP to Stacks, allowing Stacks projects to build deep liquidity and find its price efficiently with low capital requirements.

LBPs can result in a significantly better-funded project whose governance tokens are more evenly distributed among the community. This means the tokens remain in the hands of those that are invested in the project in the long term, instead of speculators looking for quick profits.
